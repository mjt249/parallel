# Particle Simulation Using OpenMP and MPI on Edison Supercomputer
The primary objective of this project is to implement an O(n)
complexity algorithm to simulate particle dynamics solely dependent on
short-range forces, and extend the serial implementation to a shared-memory
and a distributed memory implementation. See Particle_Simulation_Report.pdf for the full report.
